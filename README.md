# task-2
By examining the task which was given to me, I have come to know that I should create a console application for Student Management which is a CLI based CRUD system for managing student records.
The tool which I have used is IntelliJ IDEA and the current java version JDK-24 The Program deals with how classes are initialized in java and how they can be interacted while multiples classes are present in same directory.
